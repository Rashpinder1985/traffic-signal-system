# traffic-signal-system
This interactive simulation demonstrates **4:1 MUX and 1:4 DEMUX** concepts in a traffic system. The user (ðŸš—) selects a junction, and the system suggests the best route based on real-time traffic. Roads are color-coded, and vehicles move dynamically. The system ensures an optimal path by automatically highlighting the least congested route. ðŸš¦ðŸ›»
